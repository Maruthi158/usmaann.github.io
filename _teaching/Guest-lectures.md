**COMP5310: Principles of Data Science**
======
I am in giving tutorials to the master level students at the University of Sydney, Australia. This [course](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/COMP5310) focus on understanding and applying relevant concepts, techniques, algorithms, and tools for the analysis, management and visualisation of data- with the goal of enabling discovery of information and knowledge to guide effective decision making and to gain new insights from large data sets. 


**COMP5703: Information Technology Capstone Project**
======

I supervise master level students to complete their capstone projects to complete their master degree requirements. [Capstone project](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/COMP5703) provides an opportunity for students to carry out a defined piece of independent research or design. These skills include the capacity to define a research or design question, show how it relates to existing knowledge and carry out the research or design in a systematic manner.
